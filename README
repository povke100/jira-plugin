JIRA REST Artists plugin.

This plugin allows to search iTunes for artists and returns then in JSON format.

To use this plugin simply make a request to a following url:

 * http://<jira-location>/jira/rest/artists-resource/1.0/artists?search=<search-term>

NOTE: search query param is mandatory. Omitting this parameter, leaving it empty or blank
will return Bad request (400) response.
